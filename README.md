# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Rust.

## About

This project serves as an introduction to Rust programming, demonstrating basic concepts such as:

- Enumerations (`enum Choices` representing the player and computer choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- Methods for enums (`from_str` and `to_emoticon` for converting input strings and representing choices with emoticons).
- Error handling using `Option` and `expect`.
- Looping (`loop`) and conditional branching (`if`, `match`) for game flow control.
- Random number generation using the `rand` crate.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Build and run the application:

## Features
